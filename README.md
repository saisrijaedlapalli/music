- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for songs in the platform.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: 
  - HTML5
  - CSS3
  - JavaScript
- **Backend**:
  - PHP (for user registration, login, and database interaction)
  - MySQL (database for storing user data and song information)
- **Others**:
  - Responsive design for mobile and desktop devices
  - Audio control functionality using the HTML5 `<audio>` element

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your local machine:

1. **Web Server** (Apache, Nginx, or any PHP-supported server).
2. **PHP**: You need PHP installed to run the backend.
3. **MySQL**: To manage your database.
4. **MyPHPAdmin**: (Optional) Use this to manage the database easily.

### Steps to Run the Project Locally

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/music-streaming-platform.git
   ```

2. **Set Up Database**:
   - Go to your MySQL server and create a new database (e.g., `music_streaming`).
   - Import the database schema (you can use `phpmyadmin` or MySQL CLI to create tables).
   
   Example SQL:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE users (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
   );
   ```

3. **Configure Database Connection**:
   - Update your `db.php` file with your database credentials (host, username, password, and database name).

   Example `db.php`:
   ```php
   <?php
   $servername = "localhost";
   $username = "root";
   $password = "";
   $dbname = "music_streaming";

   // Create connection
   $conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

   if ($conn->connect_error) {
       die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
   }
   ?>
   ```

4. **Start the Server**:
   - If you are using XAMPP or WAMP, start Apache and MySQL from their control panels.
   - Otherwise, configure your own server to run PHP files.

5. **Access the Project**:
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost/music-streaming-platform/`.

### User Authentication

- **Registration**: Allows users to sign up with a username, email, and password.
- **Login**: Users can log in with their credentials (username/email and password).
- **Profile**: Once logged in, users can view and update their profile details.
- **Logout**: Users can log out and return to the login page.

## Usage

1. **Sign Up**: When a new user arrives, they can register by providing their username, email, and password.
2. **Log In**: Registered users can log in using their credentials.
3. **Dashboard**: After logging in, users are directed to their dashboard, where they can play music, manage their profiles, and view recommended songs.
4. **Music Player**: The player allows users to listen to their favorite songs.

## Features in Progress
